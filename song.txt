I see it in the air, I see it in the air
I'm running through these ashes like a firefighter

Put out the fire, put out the fire
Did we build empires just to watch them burn?
My heart's beating louder, I'm running like tigers
No fear in my eyes, though, I will save this love

The ceiling is falling, the windows are burning
It's getting harder to breathe
Can you hear me calling? I see ashes falling
I'm down on my knees, but I will save this love


I see it in the air, I see it in the air
I'm rising from thesе ashes like a phoenix, yеah
You know I'll be there
You know that I'll be there
I'm running through these ashes like your firefighter

Put out the fire (Put out the fire)
Put out the fire, put out the fire
Put out the fire, put out the fire

Come dance with that thunder
Cause love makes us stronger
We're not here forever
So can we save this love?

From lovers to fires
So why do we do this?
We're meant to rise higher
And higher, and higher

The ceiling is falling, the windows are burning
It's getting harder to breathe
Can you hear me calling? I see ashes falling
Falling, and falling

I see it in the air, I see it in the air
I'm rising from these ashes like a phoenix, yeah
You know that I'll be there
You know I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there

(I see it in the air, I see it in the air)
(We're rising from these ashes like a phoenix, yeah)
(You know we'll be there)
(You know that we'll be there)
(We're rising from these ashes like a firefighter)

I see it in the air, I see it in the air
We're rising from these ashes like a phoenix, yeah
You know you'll be there
(You know that we'll be there)
(We're rising from these ashes)
Like a firefighter
