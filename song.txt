I see it in the air, I see it in the air
I'm running through these ashes like a firefighter

Put out the fire, put out the fire
Did we build empires just to watch them burn?
My heart's beating louder, I'm running like tigers
No fear in my eyes, though, I will save this love

The ceiling is falling, the windows are burning
It's getting harder to breathe
Can you hear me calling? I see ashes falling
I'm down on my knees, but I will save this love
